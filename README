Woptic calculates the optical conductivity of interacting systems in a
maximally-localized Wannier  basis.  It is  built on top  of Wannier90
and Wien2k.  In  any published papers arising from  the use of Woptic,
please cite:

   E. Assmann, P. Wissgott, J. Kune≈°, A. Toschi, P. Blaha, and K. Held,
   arXiv:1507.04881  (http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04881)

If  you use  additional  codes  in conjunction  with  woptic, such  as
Wien2k,  wien2wannier,  or  Wannier90,  do  not  forget  to  cite  the
appropriate papers as well.
