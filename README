Woptic calculates the optical conductivity of interacting systems in a
maximally-localized  Wannier basis.   It is  built on  top of  Wien2k,
wien2wannier, and Wannier90.  In any published papers arising from the
use of Woptic, please cite:

When using additional codes in  conjunction with woptic, do not forget
to cite their appropriate papers as well.


Installation
************

0. As a prerequisite,  install Wien2k <http://wien2k.at> and Wannier90
   <http://wannier.org>.  Wien2k should  include wien2wannier (version
   14.2 or newer).

1. Get woptic  from  <https://github.com/woptic/woptic>  and  extract.
   For  the newest  code, clone  the  ‘master’ branch;  for a  stabler
   version, download the latest release.

2. Configure and compile.   For configuration, copy ‘make.sys.example’
   to ‘make.sys’ and edit; woptic uses some modules from wien2wannier,
   so use the same compiler.  To compile, run ‘make’.

3. Put  it in your  $PATH.  After compilation, the  woptic executables
   are in the subdirectory bin/.  It is easiest to add this directory
   to your $PATH.

4. Optionally, compile the user's guide.  Run ‘make doc’, resulting in
   the file ‘doc/woptic_userguide.pdf’.
