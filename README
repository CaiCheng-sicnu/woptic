Woptic calculates the optical conductivity of interacting systems in a
maximally-localized Wannier  basis.  It is  built on top  of Wannier90
and Wien2k.  In  any published papers arising from  the use of Woptic,
please cite:

   J.Kunes, R.Arita, P.Wissgott, A.Toschi, H.Ikeda, K.Held,
   Comp.Phys.Commun. 181, 1888 (2010)

If you use additional codes  to process woptic output, such as Wien2k,
wien2wannier,  or Wannier90,  do not  forget to  cite  the appropriate
papers as well.
