                    Wien2Wannier: TODO's and Ideas
                    ==============================

General:

 * write INSTALL, NEWS, README; update COPYING with reference

 * woptic e-mail address?

 * test suite (what?)

 * add version to NEWS, maybe file VERSION

 * what about spin-orbit?

 * woptic vs. $SCRATCH

 * make interpolation work with ``rotmatrix''

 * error message for “currently broken” modes

 * check / fix orb. resolved mode

 * make it work with ‘-p’
   - quick fix: make joinvec work
   - long run: make woptic_main, convert_vr accept -p

 * add note about GitHub to UG


woptic:

 * move “refine_tetra” to beginning of woptic iteration

 * convert to use ‘def’ file, or some other more sensible way

 * make check for ‘case.symop’ compulsory when necessary

 * convergence tests

 * color during iterations
   

woptic_main:

 * fix scissors shift, chemical potential

 * apply chemical potential to interacting states or all states?

 * As a function of internal frequency spacing, the dc quantities
   converge much slower than the (higher-Ω) optical conductivity.
   Does it make sense to have an extra “dc ω grid”?


refine_tetra:

 * figure out correct size for VOE


compute_vr:

 * add “-p” switch
